### Overview

For this project, I created a new React application using [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). The application renders different images to the screen, and every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order. The application keeps track of the user's score and the user's score increments when clicking an image for the first time; the user's resets to 0 if they click the same image more than once.
